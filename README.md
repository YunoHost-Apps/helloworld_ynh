# Hello World for Yunohost

Hello World is a basic dummy app to illustrate how YunoHost app packaging works.

After installing the application, you can go to `your.domain.tld/helloworld` (or whichever page you chose) and you should see a simple page that shows 'Hello World!'

This is a test, please ignore
